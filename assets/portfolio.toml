<p>
CalcuLaTeX is a pretty printing calculator language. Its goal is to make calculations easier and more presentable with real time LaTeX rendered output, support for SI units, variables, and mathematical functions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Composed of an interpreter to run the calculations and a compiler to compile expressions and their answers into LaTeX</li>
<li>Each expression is parsed twice, once for the interpreter, and once for the compiler, in order to make LaTeX output more closely mirror user input</li>
<li>Uses a comprehensive test suite and automated CI</li>
<li>CalcuLaTeX is hosted as a web app on https://calcula.tech, where it has had thousands of visitors to date.</li>
<li>300+ stars, multiple contributors on GitHub</li>
<li>Written in Rust, website built with Elixir, Phoenix Liveview, and JavaScript</li>
